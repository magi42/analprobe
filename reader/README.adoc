= Analog Reader Service
Marko Gr√∂nroos <magi@iki.fi>

The `analreader.py` service should runs on a Raspberry Pi.
Can be any machine, as long as the serial device is at `/dev/ttyACM*`.

== Configuration

Edit `analreader.py` to configure it.

`COLLECTOR`::
  Address of the collector service.

`COLLECTORPORT`::
  Port of the collector service.

`COLLECTORPATH`::
  URL path of the collector service.

`PROBEID`::
  Identifier number for the probe.

`SERIALDEV`::
  Device path for the serial connection to the probe board.

== Debug Connection

The `ssh-forever` script establishes a reverse SSH pipe.
It uses alternating port number, because there was a problem with stuck ports.

It is pretty hardcoded for my own purposes, but nevertheless it is here.
