= Analog Reader Service
Marko Gr√∂nroos <magi@iki.fi>

The `analreader.py` service is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi.
Can be any machine, as long as the serial device is at `/dev/ttyACM*`.

It should be configured to start automatically on boot.

== Configuration

Edit `analreader.py` to configure it.

`COLLECTOR`::
  Address of the collector service.

`COLLECTORPORT`::
  Port of the collector service.

`COLLECTORPATH`::
  URL path of the collector service.

`PROBEID`::
  Identifier number for the probe.

`SERIALDEV`::
  Device path for the serial connection to the probe board.

== Running

You can just run the `analreader.py` to have it do its thing.

In production use, the reader service can be started as a daemon by init.
You can install the `init.d/analreader` in `/etc/init.d`.
Edit the file to see that the path to the `analreader` script is correct.
It is by default in the home directory of the `pi` user.

== Debug Connection

The `ssh-forever` script establishes a reverse SSH pipe.
It uses an alternating port number, because there was a problem with stuck ports.

It is pretty hardcoded for my own purposes, but nevertheless it is here.

Again, there is also a `init.d/ssh-forever` init script that you can install in `/etc/init.d` to run it automatically on system boot.
