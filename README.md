Analog Probe Data Collector
===========================

This is an experimental embedded system for reading analog data from a sensor by an Arduino board.
The data is read by a reader service running in a local Raspberry Pi (or a Linux PC).
The data is sent to a web service that displays it graphically.

Features
========
 - A data collector servlet to receive data over HTTP
 - A Vaadin UI for visualizing the data
 - Written in Scala

Complete System
===============

The complete data collection system consists of:
 - An Arduino board for collecting data from probes
 - A Raspberry Pi for forwarding the data to a collector
 - A collector web service
 - A Vaadin UI for visualizing the data

This project does not currently include the Arduino or Pi code,
it will be added in future.

Development
===========
 - Install Scala IDE
 - Install Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse
 - Correct scala-library.jar must be installed in WebContent/WEB-INF/lib
 - Import as a Scala project - I haven't tried how this works
